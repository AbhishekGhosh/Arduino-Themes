Monokai Arduino Theme
================

If you love Sublime Text 2 and the Monokai Color Style, here's a similar theme/skin for the Arduino IDE.
There are not enough system variables to make it exact, but it's much better than the default.

####INSTALLATION
1. **PREFERENCES.TXT**  
On Windows, located here: `%AppData%\Roaming\Arduino` replace your `preferences.txt` with mine.
2. **THEME FOLDER**  
On Windows, located here: `..\arduino-1.0.5\lib\` replace the `theme` folder inside (making a copy of the original in case you hate my changes!)
This folder contains a 'themes.txt' file with the bulk of the changes (mostly colors).  Buttons and tabs are stored as image files, which have been modified to fit the color scheme

####PSD 'BUTTONS' FILE
The `theme` folder also includes a Photoshop (.psd) file for the buttons which includes a saved selection for easier changing of the background.  This can be accessed through the 'Channels' panel.
